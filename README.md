Yes, I understand the image. It contains the mathematical formula for **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**, which is a common metric used to measure the accuracy of a forecasting or prediction model.  

### The formula is:  
\[
MAPE = \frac{100}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right|
\]

### Where:
- \( y_i \) = Actual value  
- \( \hat{y}_i \) = Predicted value  
- \( n \) = Number of observations  

**MAPE** expresses the error as a percentage, making it easy to interpret. A lower MAPE indicates a better prediction model.
